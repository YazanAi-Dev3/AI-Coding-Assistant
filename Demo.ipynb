    "# AI Coding Assistant: A Hybrid RAG Chatbot\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates a sophisticated, hybrid chatbot designed to function as a programming assistant. The system leverages a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture to provide accurate and efficient answers to coding questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Architecture:\n",
    "-   **Retriever:** A `CodeBERT` model provides fast and contextually-aware answers for common questions stored in a pre-computed vector database.\n",
    "-   **Generator:** A powerful generative model (`microsoft/phi-2`) creates new, on-the-fly answers for novel or complex questions.\n",
    "-   **Hybrid Logic:** The system intelligently decides whether to retrieve a known answer or generate a new one based on a similarity threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo will showcase the chatbot's ability to handle both known and unknown questions."
